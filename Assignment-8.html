        <h1>The inside story: Why is Oh Noes so sad?</h1>
        
        <p>We had an exclusive interview with Oh Noes guy, the error buddy, and we asked him the question that all of you were wondering about: "Why do you always seem so sad?" Here's his shocking reply:</p>
        <p id="ohnoes-says"></p>
        
        <p>We asked Winston for comment, and this is all he would say about it:</p>
        <p id="winston-says"></p>
        <script>
            var ohnoesSays = document.getElementById("ohnoes-says");
            ohnoesSays.innerHTML= "\" Sometimes I'm done in coding and losing my <strong> mind </strong>.\"" 
            ohnoesSays.style.color="red"
            ohnoesSays.style.fontFamily="cursive"
            var winstonSays = document.getElementById("winston-says");
            winstonSays.textContent = "\"Hey my friend, it doesn't matter. you can pass it. \""
            winstonSays.style.color= "blue"
            winstonSays.style.fontFamily="cursive"
        </script>
